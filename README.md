# Sherlock

Welcome to Sherlock project. Sherlock is a movie recommendation microservice written in Flask.

Below steps can be executed on any unix like system. I will use ubuntu deployed on [O'Reilly's sandbox](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/ubuntu-sandbox/9781492062837) (alternatively you could use [Katacoda's playground](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/ubuntu/playground2004)). Once the sandbox/playground is ready, execute instructions specified in below sections.

## Setup SSH key

**This step is option and can be omitted.**
